    <p><h3>What is a Naan?</h3></p>

    <p>Naan in parts of the Indian subcontinent usually refers to a specific kind of thick flatbread. Generally, it is usually leavened with yeast or with bread starter (leavened naan dough left over from a previous batch); unleavened dough (similar to that used for roti) is also used. Naan, similar to some other breads of South Asian cuisine is cooked in a tandoor, from which tandoori cooking takes its name. This distinguishes it from roti, which is usually cooked on a tava, which is a flat (or slightly concaved) pan. Modern recipes sometimes substitute baking powder for the yeast. Milk or yogurt may also be used to impart distinct tastes to the naan. Milk used instead of water will, as it does for ordinary bread, yield a softer dough.[14] Also, when bread starter (which contains both yeast and lactobacilli) is used, the milk may undergo modest lactic fermentation.

    </p>

    <p>A typical naan recipe involves mixing white or whole wheat flour (also known as maida) with active dry yeast, salt, and water.[16] The dough is kneaded for a few minutes, then set aside to rise for a few hours. Once risen, the dough is divided into balls (about 100 g or 3.5 oz each), which are flattened and cooked.</p>

    <p>Raisins, lentils and spices can be added. Naan is a natural marriage with Indian and Bangladeshi curries and gravies and can also be covered with, or served as a wrap for, various toppings of meat, vegetables, or cheeses. This version is sometimes prepared as fast food. It can also be dipped into such soups as dal and goes well with sabzis (also known as shaakh) as well as sweet dishes.</p>

    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>4 ½ cups bread flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic (Optional)</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>

    </ul>

    <p><h3>Steps:</h3></p>

    <ul>
        <li><h4>Step 1</h4>Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl. Let stand about 10 minutes, until frothy.</li>
        <li><h4>Step 2</h4>Meanwhile, generously oil a large bowl.</li>
        <li><h4>Step 3</h4>Stir sugar, milk, egg, and salt into the yeast mixture. Mix in enough flour to make a soft dough.</li>
        <li><h4>Step 4</h4>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth, 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li><h4>Step 5</h4>Place dough in the prepared oil, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li><h4>Step 6</h4>Punch down dough on a lightly floured surface, and knead in garlic. Pinch off small handfuls of dough about the size of a golf ball; you should have about 14. Roll each piece into a ball and place on a tray. Cover with a towel, and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li><h4>Step 7</h4>Meanwhile, preheat a large grill pan over high heat.</li>
        <li><h4>Step 8</h4>Roll each piece of dough into a thin circle.</li>
        <li><h4>Step 9</h4>Brush some melted butter on the preheated grill pan. Place a few pieces of dough in the pan (as many as you can fit) and cook until puffy and lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Brush butter onto the uncooked sides, flip, and cook until browned, 2 to 4 more minutes. Remove from the grill and repeat to cook the remaining naan.</li>
        <li><h4>Step 10</h4>Enjoy!  </li>
