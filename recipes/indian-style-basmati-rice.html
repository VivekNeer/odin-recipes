    <p>This savory Indian rice recipe is flavored with whole spices and fried onions. Soaking the basmati rice before cooking makes all the difference. Serve this Indian-style rice with your favorite Indian curry or dal (lentils). Make sure you warn people not to bite into the whole spices!

    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups basmati rice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 (2 inch) piece cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>2 pods green cardamom</li>
        <li>2 whole cloves</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cumin seed</li>
        <li>1 small onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>


    </ul>

    <p><h3>Steps:</h3></p>

    <ul>
        <li><h4>Step 1</h4>Place rice into a bowl with enough water to cover. Set aside to soak for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li><h4>Step 2</h4>Meanwhile, in the last 10 minutes of soaking, heat oil in a large pot or saucepan over medium heat. Add cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, and cloves, then stir in cumin seed. Cook and stir until fragrant and toasted, about a minute, then add onion to the pot. Saute onion until the color is a rich golden brown, about 10 minutes.

        </li>
        <li><h4>Step 3</h4>Drain water from rice, and stir into the pot. Cook and stir rice until lightly toasted, about 3 minutes. Add water and salt, and bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to low.

        </li>
        <li><h4>Step 4</h4>Simmer for about 15 minutes, or until all the water has been absorbed. Let stand for 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork before serving.

        </li>
      
    </ul>
